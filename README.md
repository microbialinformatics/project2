Project 2: Software development
========

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that encapsulates a number of functions to do something useful. The assignment is due on December 16, 2014, which is the normal date for the final in this class [there is no final!]. The project should be submitted as a repository on your GitHub account with an appropriate license and a README.

The README file should be a markdown file that is generated from an Rmarkdown/knitr-based file. This file should demonstrate how to install, load, and use the program. Note that the README should be reproducible by anyone else. Your R code should be well written, commented, and follow the practices we have discussed in class. You are free to incorporate other packages into your code, but of course, when someone loads your code it needs to load these dependencies as well. Furthermore, if your README demo depends on a dataset, then there needs to be access to an example/toy dataset in your repository.
